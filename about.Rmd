title: "About this site"
description: |
  My name is Li Minqi, a student from MITB SMU. This site is my learning on visualisation by using R studio. On this website, you are able to find all my applications of visualisation skills that I learnt from class. All analysis are done by using data set provided by [**VAST Challenge 2022**](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/).
  To know more about me, please find my CV from [`here`](Resume of Li Minqi (MITB, FTA , Aug 2021 cohort).pdf)
